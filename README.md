This is a personal project I started to learn more about SDL3 and to create games from scratch. 

I'm a computer science major with a minor in Game Development and Design. I know engines like Unity and Unreal are useful, but this approach feels more direct and hands on to me, and I'm learning new things every commit. 

The premise started simple with just a player object and movement, and development has been dictated by the assets I find available for free online. 
Currently it's an asteroids like ship shooter
